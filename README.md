Mongoose Version is a mongoose plugin to save document data versions. Documents are saved to a "versioned" document collection before saving
original documents and kept for later use.

## Installation

    $ npm install mongoose-version

## Usage
To use mongoose-version for an existing mongoose schema you'll have to require and plugin mongoose-version into the 
existing schema.

The following schema definition defines a "Page" schema, and uses mongoose-version plugin with default options

```js
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Schema = mongoose.Schema;
var version = require('mongoose-version');

var Page = new Schema({
  title : { type : String, required : true},
  content : { type : String, required : true },
  path : { type : String, required : true},
  tags : [String],

  lastModified : Date,
  created : Date
});

Page.plugin(version);
```

Mongoose-version will define a schema that has a refId field pointing to the original model and a version array containing
cloned copies of the versioned model.

Mongoose-version will add a static field to Page, that is "VersionedModel" that can be used to access the versioned
model of page, for example for querying old versions of a document.

## Option keys and defaults
* model/collection: name of the model. By default, mongoose pluralizes the model name and initializes that as the collection name. The default value is 'versions'. You should supply this option if you're using mongoose-version on more than one schema.
* dbCollection: name of the model. Use this to override the collection name.
* suppressVersionIncrement: mongoose-version will not increment the version of the saved model before saving the model by default. To turn on auto version increment set this option to false. Default: `true`
* suppressRefIdIndex: mongoose-version will not index the refId field by default. To turn on indexing on refId set this option to false. Default: `true`
* strategy: mongoose-version allows versioned document to be saved as multiple documents in a collection or in a single document in a version array. In case you want to save documents in an array specify `array` strategy, for storing versioned documents in multiple documents specify `collection` strategy. Default `array`.
* maxVersions: Only valid for `array` strategy. Specifies how many historic versions of a document should be kept. Defaults to `Number.MAX_VALUE`.
* mongoose: Pass a mongoose instance to work with
* removeVersions: Removes versions when origin document is removed. Defaults to `false`
* ignorePaths: Defines an array of document field names that do not trigger a new version to be created when this field was changed. Only working with array strategy (default strategy). Defaults to `[]`.
* refIdType: The type of the `_id` field used in your document. Will be used to set the type of the refId. Defaults to `ObjectId`.
* Options are passed to a newly created mongoose schemas as settings, so you may use any [option supported by mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#options)

In case you only want to specify the collection name, you can pass a string instance to options that is taken as collection name. Options may be passed as follows:

```js
Page.plugin(version, { collection: 'Page__versions' });
```

## Misc

### Debug Messages

Mongoose-version uses the [debug module](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) for debug messages. You can enable mongoose-version debug logs by setting the
`DEBUG` environment variable to `mongoose:version`.

    DEBUG=mongoose:version

on Windows use

    SET DEBUG=mongoose:version

Debug messages are logged if a version was persisted to mongodb or a version was removed from mongodb.
